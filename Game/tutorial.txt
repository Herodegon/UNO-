=== What Is UNO ===

UNO is a card game by Mattel Games. The goal is for the players to get rid of their hand as quickly as
possible while keeping the other players from doing the same using a variety of different card effects.
Once a player is down to their last card, they call "UNO!" to let everyone know that they only need to
play one more card. After their last card is played, they are declared the winner! They can then choose
to go another round, or quit. If they continue, the rest of the game uses the score system: each card is
given a score, and every card in each player's hand is tallied for the winner of the round. When either
3 rounds have passed, or the players have decided to quit (whichever comes first), the winner is declared
based on the score.

=== How To Play ===

1) At the start of every new round the deck is shuffled, each player draws 7 cards, and a card is drawn 
   for the top of the discard pile.

2) Every turn a player plays a card matching the number, type, or color of the top card on the discard
     pile. 
   
3) If they do not have a card that matches the number, type, or color of the top card, the player must draw 
     a card from the deck.
   
4) If the drawn card can be played, the player must play their new card.

5) Once a player is left with only one card, they call "UNO!," and must play their last card to win.

6) After a player has played their last card, they win the round.

7) If the game is multi-round, the player hands are tallied and added to the winner's score total.

8) Once the players decide to end the multi-round game, or after the players play their fifth round
   (whichever comes first), player scores are evaluated and the player with the highest score wins.
